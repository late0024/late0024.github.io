            About me
        </h3>
        <hr>
        <p> 
            I am a Software Engineering student who has switched into Interactive Media Design. I always enjoyed design and even have taught myself a lot of design programs such as Blender, Clip studio Paint, Premiere Pro. I mostly dive into 3d designing and printing and have many different projects under my best though I need to upload them to my portfolio to showcase. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            Other than art I also enjoy a lot of different hobbies such as video games, cooking, sports(<em>Rugby, Swimming, Rock climbing</em>), web development, and spending time with friends. I also am the type of person to always want to learn new things and new skill sets but I also am recognizing the issue of where if I do not focus on one skillset I will not be good enough to specialise in the 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup> or any hobbie after those, so now I try to improve in a lot of the aspects that I enjoy while leading a balanced life
